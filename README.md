# Quizzard
Android application for online quiz assessment.

In recent times due to the COVID-19 situations and Lockdowns colleges have to function in online mode.
However, classes could be conducted on various platforms but there is not an organised method of academic 
assessment. Since mid-semester examinations could not be conducted in colleges so there is a need of an online 
platform for colleges where Quizzes could be conducted and graded.
